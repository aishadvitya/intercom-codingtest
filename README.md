2. Proudest Acheivement:

     A few years back i was working in a big MNC with decent pay , in a large team. However after 2 years of working there - i realized
     that there was nothing challening about being in my comfort zone . In the meantime a bunch of my old college folks were trying to
     revamp a start up that went bankrupt a few years back. The company did not have an entity registered in Singpore - they were still looking 
     out for investors.I quit my job , and joined the startup. We were only 2 developers( we were also the testers, infrastructure guys .. ) 
     It was literally 14 hrs work days for months together. 
     But we were quickly able to see results and in the process got to work on some really cool stuff:
        
        . we had revamped the entire architecture from normal vanilla web application to a multitenanted microservices based SAAS application.
        . We had increased & more customer on-app time(about 50% !)  with SSO.(We also got a long term client all thanks to the feature)
        . By the end of 8 months we went from bankruptcy to 4 major clients & a series B funding and 15 member Dev Team. 
     
     It might sound passive, but leaving that job is the best move ive made. It taught me something i still take very seriously. 
     The Devil is in the Details.
